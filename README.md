# ploeh blog

This repository contains the templates and data for my blog at <http://blog.ploeh.dk>. It is powered by [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com).

## Comments

As an experiment, all comments for a particular post are kept as part of the post itself.

If you wish to comment on a particular post, send me a pull request for that post. If you're in doubt about the format, just look at how previous comments are formatted. For an example of a post with comments, see e.g. [the very first post on this blog](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2009/01/28/LivingInInterestingTimes).

## Contributions

While *ploeh blog* is my personal blog, I'm happy to accept contributions such as:

* Comments (see above)
* Corrections of typos and the like
* Look and feel enhancements (better CSS, etc.)

On the other hand, I don't intend to turn *ploeh blog* into a site with 'guest bloggers', so don't bother sending an unsolicited pull request for a completely new post.
