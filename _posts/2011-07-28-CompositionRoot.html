	<div class="comment-content">Reading the pre-release and it's very good. As for the single composition root: what about complex apps with several deep features?  These features could be considered by some to be mini-apps in and of themselves.   Would it be appropriate to consider each feature to have its own composition root?  I'm thinking of Unity's child containers here. Hopefully the question makes sense. As I use your book as ammo at work I come across the particular question. </div>

	<div class="comment-content">Each application/process requires only a single Composition Root. It doesn't matter how complex the application is.<br>

The earlier you compose, the more you limit your options, and there's simply no reason to do that.<br>

	<div class="comment-content">Hi Mark,<br>
<br>
My question is quite parallel to David’s. How about we have a complex application that loads its modules dynamically on-demand, and these modules can consist of multiple assemblies. <br>
<br>
For example, a client application that has a page-based navigation. Different modules can be deployed and undeployed all the time. At design-time we don’t know all the types we wanna compose and we don’t have direct reference to them. <br>
<br>
Should we introduce some infrastructure code, like David suggested, to let the modules register their own types (e.g. services) to a child container, then we apply “resolve” on the loaded module and dispose the child container when we are done with the module?<br>
<br>
Looking forward to the final release of your book BTW :-)<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

	<div class="comment-content">The problem with letting each module register their own types to any sort of container is that it tightly couples the modules (and <em>any</em> application in which you might want to use them) to a specific container. Even worse, if you ever need to consume a service provided by one module from another module, you'd have to couple these two to each other. Pretty soon, you'll end up with a tightly coupled mess.<br>
<br>
One option is to use whichever DI Container you'd like from the Composition Root, and use its XML capabilities to configure the modules into each particular application that needs them. That's always possible, but adds some overhead, and is rarely required.<br>
<br>
A better option is to simply drop all desired modules in an add-in folder and then use convention-based rules to scan each assembly. The most difficult part of that exercise is that you have to think explicitly about cardinality, but that's always an issue with add-in architectures. The MEF chapter of my book discusses cardinality a bit.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I left your book at home, never mind it's here on my desk. I was going to ask what your composition root for asp.net webforms looked like, but here it is on pg 227.<br>
<br>
I think I'm headed in <br>
UI(Asp.net) depends on Presentation layer and a pure interfaces/DTOs (with any serialization attributes/methods needed). so structure/schema of the 'model' lives in that domain-schema layer. domain model depends on the domain-schema layer, but is purely behaviors (methods/logic). In this way there's a sharing of schema/dto between service layer and presentation layer, with the clean separation  of all business logic and only business logic living in the domain layer.So outside of the composition root, neither the UI, presentation layer, or resource access layers (public api -&gt; internal adapter-&gt; individual resource) can touch the domain methods or types. Requires we define an interface for the domain model classes I think? Cross cutting-concerns would live in their own assembly.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts?</div>

	<div class="comment-content">Why would your UI depend on DTOs? A Data Transfer Object plays the role of a boundary data carrier, just like View Model might do - they fit architecturally at the same place of application architecture: <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/05/31/AtTheBoundariesApplicationsAreNotObjectOriented.aspx">at the boundary</a>. If you base your inner architecture upon DTOs you'll be headed in the direction of an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html">Anemic Domain Model</a>, so that doesn't sound a particularly good idea to me...</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I'm only up to reading mid-way through your chapter on doing it right (and jumped to the asp.net webforms composition root after reading this blog post), but here is more of my reasoning.<br>
<br>
<i>The catch comes when you look at the behavior, and you realize that there is hardly any behavior on these objects, making them little more than bags of getters and setters. Indeed often these models come with design rules that say that you are not to put any domain logic in the the domain objects. </i><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html">AnemicDomain Models</a> - Martin Fowler<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>It becomes a 'real' domain model when it contains all (or most) of the behaviour that makes up the business domain (note I'm emphasising business logic, not UI or other orthogonal concerns).</i> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1805641/anemic-domain-model-versus-domain-model/1807593#1807593">Anemic Domain Models</a> - Stack overflow<br>
<br>
I don't feel that this is headed into an Anemic domain model as the domain model assembly would contain all behaviors specific to the domain.<br>
<br>
<i>  Designs that share very little state or, even better, have no state at all tend to be less prone to hard to analyze bugs and easier to repurpose when requirements change.</i> <a href="http://www.colourcoding.net/blog/archive/2009/07/21/gang-of-four-anti-patterns.aspx">Blog article</a> - makes sense but i could be missing multiple boats here.<br>
<br>
The domain would have zero state, and would depend on interfaces not DTOs. This would make test-ability and analysis simple.<br>
<br>
 Motivation for DTOs in the interfaces layer: presentation and persistence could all share the DTOs rather than having them duplicated in either place.<br>
Barring that perceived gain, then the shared layer across all would just be interfaces.<br>
<br>
 The UI could depend on interfaces only, but the same assembly would contain DTOs that the presentation layer and any persistence could share without having to be duplicated/rewritten. So the domain is completely persistence and presentation ignorant.</div>

<br>
The purpose of a DTO is &quot;to transfer multiple items of data between two processes in a single method call.&quot; That is (I take it) not what you are attempting to do here.<br>
<br>
Whether or not you implement the business logic in the same assembly as your DTOs has nothing to with avoiding an Anemic Domain Model. The behavior must be defined by the object that holds the data.</div>

	<div class="comment-content">I appreciate your exhortations to good architecture, but I am struggling to apply them in my situation.<br>
<br>
I am writing a WPF system tray application which has a primary constraint to keep lean, especially in terms of performance and memory usage. This constraint, along with the relatively low complexity of the application, means that I cannot justify the overhead of MVVM. In the absence of a prescribed architecture for building the object graph, I could set one up 'manually' in Application.OnStartup. Presumably it would mean instantiating all the Window objects (with dependences), which are utilised from time to time by the user.<br>
<br>
However, I have a problem with these Window instance sitting in memory, doing nothing, 90% of the time. It seems much more sensible to me to instantiate these Window objects in the events where the user asks for them. Yet, I will want to maintain the inversion of control, so how can I avoid accessing the DI container in multiple points in my app?</div>

<br>
I wanted to post the following comment on your linked page, here<br>
http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/03/04/ComposeObjectGraphsWithConfidence.aspx<br>
but I am encountering a page error on submission.<br>
<br>
The above article suggests a great framework for delayed construction of resources, however I have a different reason for wanting this than loading an assembly.<br>
<br>
In my scenario I have occasionally-needed Window objects with heavy GUIs, presenting lots of data. The GUI and data only need to be in memory while the Window is displayed. The lazy loading approach seems to apply, except it leaves me with a couple of questions.<br>
<br>
1) When the window is closed again, I want to release the resources. How can I unload and reload it again?<br>
<br>
2) What would this line look like when using an IoC like Ninject?<br>
<br>
&gt; new Lazy&lt;ISolo&lt;IMarker&gt;&gt;(() =&gt; new C1(<br>
<br>
An alternative I am considering is putting classes defining events in the object graph, instead of the windows themselves. These event classes could be constructed with instances of dependencies which will be used in the event methods to construct Windows when needed. The dependancies I am wanting to inject to maintain inversion of control are light-weight objects like persistance services which will exist as singletons in memory anyway (due to the way most IoC's work). Do you see any problem with this?<br>
<br>
Many thanks.</div>

I would like to touch and expand upon the subject David Martin raised regarding complex applications with deep features.<br />
You make the point that only the composition root should register dependencies of various layers and components. And thereby only the project containing the composition root would have references to the DI container being used <br />
<br />
In a couple of projects I've worked on we have multiple applications and thereby composition root, being websites, service endpoint, console applications etc. giving us around 10 application endpoints that needs to have their own composition roots. 
But at the same time we work with a components based design which nicely encapsulates different aspects of the system. <br />
<br />
If I were to only do my registration code within the place of the composition roots, then applications using the same components would have to register exactly the same dependencies per compontent, leading to severe code duplication<br />
At this point we've gone with a solution where every component has their own registration class which the composition root's then register, so basically out composition roots only compose another level of composition roots. I hope it makes sense!<br />
<br />
What I'm explaining here directly violates the principles you make in this post. Which I already had I sense it would. But at the same time I don't know how else to manage this situation effectively. Do you have any ideas for how to handle this type of situation?

				Allan, thank you for writing. In the end, you'll need to do what makes sense to you, and based on what you write, it may make sense to do what you do. Still, my first reaction is that I would probably tend to <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/08/07/why-dry">worry less about duplication</a> than you seem to do. However, I don't know your particular project: neither how big your Composition Roots are, or how often they change. In other words, it's easy enough for me to say that a bit of duplication is okay, but that may not fit your reality at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another point is that, in my experience at least, even if you have different applications (web sites, services, console applications, etc.) as part of the same overall system, and they share code, the way they <em>should</em> be composed tend to diverge the longer they live. This is reminiscent of Mathias Verraes' point that <a href="http://verraes.net/2014/08/dry-is-about-knowledge/">duplication may be coincidental</a>, but that the duplicated code may deviate from each other in the future. This could also happen for such applications; e.g. at one point, you may wish to <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/09/20/InstrumentationwithDecoratorsandInterceptors">instrument</a> some of your web site's dependencies, but not your batch job.
			</p>
			<p>
				My best advice is to build smaller systems, in order to keep complexity down, and then build more of them, rather than building big systems. Again, that advice may not be useful in your case...
			</p>
			<p>
				Another option, since you mention component-based design, is to <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/11/06/WhentouseaDIContainer">move towards a convention-based approach</a>, so that you don't have to maintain those Composition Roots at all: just drop in the binaries, and let your DI Container take care of the rest. Take a look at the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) for inspiration. Still, while MEF exposes some nice ideas, and is a good source of inspiration, I would personally chose to do something like this with a proper DI Container that also supports run-time Interception and programmable Pointcuts.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end, I think I understand your problem, but my overall reaction is that you seem to have a problem you shouldn't have, so my priority would be:
				<ol>
					<li>Remove the problem altogether.</li>
					<li>Live with it.</li>
					<li>If that's not possible, solve it with technology.</li>
				</ol>

			It seems that I have a certan inclination for reopening <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/03/26/IQueryableTisTightCoupling">"old"</a> posts.
			Still the may be considered evergreens! :) Now back on topic.
		</p>
		<p>
			When it comes to the well known frameworks as ASP.NET MVC, Web.API, WCF, it is quite clear on where and how to set our composition root.
			But what if we do not have a clear "entry point" to our code?
			Imagine that you are writing an SDK, laying down some classes that will be used by other developers.
			Now, you have a class that exposes the following constructor.
			<p>
				public MyClass(IWhatEver whatEver)
			</p>
			Consider also that who is going to use this classes has no idea about IWhatEver nor it should have.
			For make the usage of MyClass as simple as possible, we I should be able to instatiate MyClass via the parameterless constructor.
			I had the idea of making the constructor that is used for DI, internal, and the only publically available one to be the paramtereless constructor.
			Then fetch somehow the instances of my dependencies in the paramterless constructor.
			
			Now imagine that I have several of classes as MyClass and that I do have a common set of "services" that are injected inside of them.
			
			Now, my questions are.
			<ol type="1">
				<li>
					Can I still have the single composition root?
				</li>
				<li>
					How do I trigger the composition?
				</li>
				<li>
					Does recreating the composition root per each "high level" class has a significant performance impact (considering a dependency tree of let's say 1000 objects).
				</li>
				<li>
					Is there a better way (pattern) to solve a problem like this?
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			Some of this questions may be slightly off topic, still the main question is, how to deal with the composition root in cases like this cases.
			
			Hoping you will make some clarity,
			I do thank you in advance.

				Mario, thank you for writing. If you're writing an SDK, you are writing either a library or a framework, so the Composition Root pattern isn't appropriate (as stated above). Instead, consider the guidelines for writing <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-library">DI friendly libraries</a> or <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-framework">DI friendly frameworks</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, in order to answer your specific questions:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1:</strong> Conceptually, there should only be a <em>single</em> Composition Root, but it belongs to the application, so as a library developer, then no: 'you' can't have any Composition Root.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2:</strong> A library shouldn't trigger any composition, but <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-library">as I explain in my guidelines for writing DI friendly libraries</a>, you can provide Facades to make the learning curve gentle. For frameworks, you may need to <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-framework">provide appropriate Abstract Factories</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>3:</strong> The <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/03/04/Composeobjectgraphswithconfidence">performance impact of Composition shouldn't be a major concern</a>. However, the real problem of attempting to apply the Composition Root pattern where it doesn't apply is that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9503612/126014">it increases coupling</a> and takes away options that the client developer may want to utilize; e.g. how can a client developer <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/09/20/InstrumentationwithDecoratorsandInterceptors">instrument a sub-graph with Decorators</a> if that sub-graph isn't available?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>4: </strong> There are better ways to design <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-library">DI friendly libraries</a> and <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-framework">DI friendly frameworks</a>.

			Thank you for your quick and valuable replay.
		</p>
		<p>	
			I read your posts and made some toughs about them. Still I am not convinced that what is described in that posts does tackle my problem. Even more I'm realizing that is less and less relevant to the topic of composition root.
			However, let me try describe a situation.
		</p>
		<p>	
			I do plan to write an SDK (a library that will allow developers to interact with my application and use some of it's functionality).
			Consider that I'm exposing a class called FancyCalculator. FancyCalculater needs to get some information from the settings repository.
			Now, I have a dependency on ISettingsRepository implementation and it is injected via a constructor into my FancyCalculator.
			Nevertheless, who is going to use the FancyCalculator, doesn't know and he shouldn't know anything about ISettingsRepository and it's dependency tree.
			He is expected only to make an instance of FancyCalculator and call a method on it.
			I do have a single implementation of ISettingsRepository in form of SettingsRepository class.
			In this case, how do I get to create an instance of SettingsRepository once my FancyCalculator is created?
		</p>
		<p>
			A Factory? Service locator? Something else?
		</p>	
		<p>
			Composition root in applications like MVC, WebAPI, etc, is a very nice and clean approach, but what about the situations when we do not have a clean single entry point to the application?
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you again!

				Mario, thank you for writing again. As far as I understand, you basically have this scenario:
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:13;color:black;"><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FancyCalculator</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">ISettingsRepository</span>&nbsp;settingsRepository;
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Then you say: "a dependency on ISettingsRepository implementation and it is injected via a constructor into my FancyCalculator". Okay, that means this:

				<pre style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:13;color:black;"><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FancyCalculator</span>

				But then you say: "who is going to use the FancyCalculator, doesn't know and he shouldn't know anything about ISettingsRepository and it's dependency tree."
			</p>
			<p>
				That sounds to me like mutually exclusive constraints. Why are you injecting ISettingsRepository into FancyCalculator if you don't want to enable the user to supply any implementation of ISettingsRepository? If you don't want to allow that, the solution is easy:

				<pre style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:13;color:black;"><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FancyCalculator</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">ISettingsRepository</span>&nbsp;settingsRepository;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;FancyCalculator()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.settingsRepository&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">DefaultSettingsRepository</span>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want the best of both worlds, the solution is the Facade pattern I already described in my <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-library">DI Friendly library</a> article.

		Hi Mark,
		
		You got the example right. The reason of my choices are the following.
		I do not want user of my library to know about the dependencies for a couple of reason. First of all it needs to be as simple as possible to use. Second thing the dependencies are let's say "internal", so that code is loosely coupled and testable.
		He should not know even about them or get bothered at any point.
		
		Still I do not think it's wise to create instances of the dependencies in the parameterless constructor. Why? Well, I am concerned about maintainability. I would like a to somehow request the default instance of my dependency in the parameterless constructor and get it, so that I do have a single point in my sdk where teh default dependency is specified, and also that I do not need to handle the dependency tree.
		The fact is that I can't get what this something should be. I re-read the chapter 5 of your book this weekend to see if I can come up with something valid ideas. What I came up with is that I should use the parameterless constructor of each of my classes to handle it's own default dependencies. In this way, resolving the tree should be fine, and it is easy to maintain. Also to prevent user to see the constructors that to require the dependencies to be injected (and confuse it) I tough of declaring these constructors as internal.
		This are my words translated in code (easier to understand).

		What do you think about a solution like this? What are a bad sides of this approach? Is there any pattern that encapsulates a practise like this?
