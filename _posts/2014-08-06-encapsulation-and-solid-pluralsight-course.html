    <em>My latest Pluralsight course is now available. This time it's about fundamental programming techniques.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Most programmers I meet know about <em>encapsulation</em> and <em>Object-Oriented Design</em> (OOD) - at least, until I start drilling them on specifics. Apparently, the way most people have been taught OOD is at odds with my view on the subject. For a long time, I've wanted to teach OOD the way I think it should be taught. My perspective is chiefly based on Bertrand Meyer's <a href="http://amzn.to/1claOin">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a> and Robert C. Martin's SOLID principles (presented, among other sources, in <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a>). My focus is on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command Query Separation</a>, protection of invariants, and favouring Composition over Inheritance.

    In <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/encapsulation-solid">my new Pluralsight course</a>, I'm happy to be able to teach OOD the way I think it should be taught. The course is aimed at professional developers with a couple of years of experience, but it's based on decades of experience (mine and others'), so I hope that even seasoned programmers can learn a thing or two from watching it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What you will learn</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    How do you make your code easily usable for other people? By following the actionable, measurable rules laid forth by Command/Query Separation as well as Postelâ€™s law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Learn how to write maintainable software that can easily respond to changing requirements, using object-oriented design principles. First, you'll learn about the fundamental object-oriented design principle of Encapsulation, and then you'll learn about the five SOLID principles - also known as <em>the principles of object-oriented design</em>. There are plenty of code examples along the way; they are in C#, but written in such a way that they should be easily understandable to readers of Java, or other curly-brace-based languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Is OOD still relevant?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular, and regular readers of this blog will have noticed that I, myself, write <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/tags.html#F#-ref">a fair amount of F# code</a>. In light of this, is OOD still relevant?
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a lot of Object-Oriented code out there, or at least, code written in a nominally Object-Oriented language, and it's not going to go away any time soon. Getting better at maintaining and evolving Object-Oriented code is, in my opinion, still important.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the principles I cover in this course are also relevant in Functional Programming.

    <div class="comment-content">I'm really enjoying your presentation! It is easy to follow and understand your explanations. I have a bit of a tangent question about your TryRead method in the Encapsulation module. You mention that your final implementation has a race condition in it. Can you explain the race condition?</div>
