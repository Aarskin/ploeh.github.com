    <em>Test-Driven Development and Functional Programming is a match made in heaven. Learn how and why in my new Pluralsight course.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    A common criticism against Test-Driven Development (TDD) is that it <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html">leads to <em>Test-Induced Damage</em></a>. However, it doesn't have to be that way, and it turns out that with Functional Programming (FP), the design ideals of FP coincide with TDD.

     In my new Pluralsight course on <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1017843&b=611266&m=53701&afftrack=&urllink=www%2Epluralsight%2Ecom%2Fcourses%2Ffsharp%2Dtest%2Ddriven%2Ddevelopment">Test-driven Development with F#</a>, you'll learn how the intersection between TDD and F# presents opportunities for better design and better testability.
