  <p>
    Over the years, there's been much criticism of Test-Driven Development (TDD). Perhaps <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> best condensed this criticism by claiming that <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html">TDD leads to test-induced design damage</a>. This isn't a criticism you can just brush away; it hits a sore point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally, I don't believe that TDD <em>has</em> to lead to test-induced damage (not even in Object-Oriented Programming), but I'm the first to admit that <a href="/2010/12/22/TheTDDApostate">it's not a design methodology</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this article, though, you're going to learn about the fundamental reason that TDD with <em>Functional Programming</em> doesn't lead to test-induced damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Functional Programming, the ideal function is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">Pure function</a>. A Pure function is a function that always returns the same value given the same input, and has no side-effects.
  </p>
  <h3 id="a20359945e5c406a8dbf3bd692dc2a1b">
    Isolation <a href="#a20359945e5c406a8dbf3bd692dc2a1b" title="permalink">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    The first characteristic of a Pure function means that an ideal function can't depend on any implicit knowledge about the external world. Only the input into the function can influence the evaluation of the function.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what <a href="http://jessitron.com">Jessica Kerr</a> <a href="http://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-8-jessica-kerr">calls <em>Isolation</em></a>. A function has the property of Isolation when the only information it has about the external word is passed into it via arguments.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can think about Isolation as the <em>dual</em> of Encapsulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Object-Oriented Programming, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29">Encapsulation</a> is a very important concept. It means that while an object contains state, the external world doesn't know about that state, unless the object <strong>explicitly makes it available</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Functional Programming, a function is Isolated when it knows nothing about the state of the external world, unless it's <strong>explicitly made available to it</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Pure function, the ideal of Functional Programming, is Isolated.

  <p>
    Why is this interesting?
  </p>
  <p>
    It's interesting if you start to think about what unit testing means. There are tons of conflicting definitions of what exactly constitutes a unit test, but most experts seem to be able to agree on this broad definition:
    <blockquote>
      A unit test is an automated test that tests a unit in isolation from its dependencies.
    </blockquote>
    Notice the use of the word <em>Isolation</em> in that definition. In order to unit test, you'll have to be able to isolate the unit from its dependencies. This is the requirement that tends to lead to Test-Induced Damage in Object-Oriented Programming. While there's nothing about Encapsulation that explicitly states that it's forbidden to isolate an object from its dependencies, it offers no help on the matter either. Programmers are on their own, because this concern isn't ingrained into Object-Oriented Programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/content/binary/encapsulation-isolation-venn.png" alt="Venn diagram showing that while there's an intersection between Encapsulation and Isolation, it's only here that Object-Oriented Programming is also testable.">
  </p>
  <p>
    You can do TDD with Object-Oriented Programming, and as long as you stay within the intersection of Encapsulation and Isolation, you may be able to stay clear of test-induced damage. However, that zone of testability isn't particularly big, so it's easy to stray. You have to be very careful and know what you're doing. Not surprisingly, many books and articles have been written about TDD, including <a href="/tags.html#Unit Testing-ref">quite a few on this blog</a>.

  <p>
    In Functional Programming, on the other hand, Isolation is the ideal. An ideal function is already isolated from its dependencies, so no more design work is required to make it testable.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/content/binary/ideal-function-isolation-testability-stacked-venn.png" alt="Stacked Venn diagram that show that an ideal function is a subset of isolated functions, which is again a subset of testable functions.">
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideal Functional design is not only ideal, but also perfectly testable, so there's no conflict. This is the underlying reason that TDD doesn't lead to test-induced damage with Functional Programming.

  </h3>
  <p>
    Isolation is an important quality of Functional Programming. An ideal function is Isolated, and that means that it's intrinsically testable. You don't have to tweak any design principles in order to make a function testable - in fact, if a function isn't testable, it's a sign that it's poorly designed. Thus, <strong>TDD doesn't lead to Test-Induced Damage in Functional Programming</strong>.

				What do you mean by "value"?  Can an exception instance be a value?  More specifically, would you say that the C# function <code>int Foo() =&gt; new Exception();</code> is pure?
			</p>
			<p>
				Many of your posts mention pure funcitons and at least a few of them include your own definition.  I decided to comment on this post since it was the oldest post I found that included your own definition of a pure function.

        Tyson, thank you for writing. I don't think that <code>int Foo() =&gt; new Exception();</code> compiles...
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from that, how do you find that this is my own definition of a pure function? It seems to me to be a standard and non-controversial definition. I even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">link to the Wikipedia definition</a> in the beginning of the article.

				I am not trying claim that any particular definition of a pure function is non-standard or is controversial.  I also don't mean that the text I quoted is "your definition" in the sense that it semantically differs from the one on Wikipedia.  I just mean that it is "your definition" in the sense that you have syntactically included in your post the text that I quoted.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, I am unsure about the precise meaning the defintion for a pure function that you have syntactically included in your post and that I quoted.  To help me improve my understanding of that defintion, I tried to ask you if a particular C# function is pure.
			</p>
			<blockquote>

			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Ah, yes.  Thanks for alerting me to my mistake.  I meant to include the <code>throws</code> keyword as well.  For clarity, I now repeat that whole paragraph but with the prose "thrown" and the keyword <code>throws</code> added.
			</p>
			<p>
				What do you mean by "value"?  Can a thrown exception instance be a value?  More specifically, would you say that the C# function <code>int Foo() =&gt; throws new Exception();</code> is pure?
