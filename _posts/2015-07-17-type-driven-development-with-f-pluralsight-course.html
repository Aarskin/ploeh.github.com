    <em>The F# type system can do much more than C# or Java's type system. Learn how to use it as a design feedback technique in my new Pluralsight course.</em>
  </p>

    My new Pluralsight course, <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1017843&b=611266&m=53701&afftrack=&urllink=www%2Epluralsight%2Ecom%2Fcourses%2Ffsharp%2Dtype%2Ddriven%2Ddevelopment">Type-Driven Development with F#</a>, first walks you through three modules of exploration of a real problem, showing various ways you can take advantage of the type system in an <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1017843&b=611266&m=53701&afftrack=&urllink=www%2Epluralsight%2Ecom%2Fcourses%2Foutside%2Din%2Dtdd">Outside-in</a> fashion.

    It then shows you how to stabilize the prototype using <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1017843&b=611266&m=53701&afftrack=&urllink=www%2Epluralsight%2Ecom%2Fcourses%2Ffsharp%2Dproperty%2Dbased%2Dtesting%2Dintroduction">Property-based Testing</a> with FsCheck.
