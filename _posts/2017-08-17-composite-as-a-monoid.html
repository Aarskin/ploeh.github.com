		<em>When can you use the Composite design pattern? When the return types of your methods are monoids.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		This article is part of <a href="">a series of articles about structural design patterns and their category theory counterparts</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern">Composite</a> design pattern is a powerful way to structure code, but not all objects are composable. When is an object composable? This article explores that question.
	</p>
	<p>
		In short, Composites are monoids.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/composite-monoid-venn-diagram.png" alt="Venn diagram showing significant overlap between Composite and monoid.">
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't claim that these are <a href="">isomorphic</a>, but I do believe that there's significant overlap. You may be able to construct Composites that aren't monoids, and not all monoids are Composites. In fact, I suspect the relationship to be more asymmetric than the diagram suggests. I think that most monoids aren't Composites, but that there are only some edge cases of Composites that aren't monoids.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Composite</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		First, I'll use various <a href="">software design isomorphisms</a> to put Composite in a canonical form. From <a href="">unit isomorphisms</a>, <a href="">function isomorphisms</a>, and <a href="">argument list isomorphisms</a>, we know that we can represent any method as a method or function that takes a single argument, and returns a single output value. From <a href="">abstract class isomorphism</a> we know that we can represent an abstract class as one or more interfaces. Thus, you can represent the interface for a Composite like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IInterface1</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Out1</span>&nbsp;Op1(<span style="color:#2b91af;">In1</span>&nbsp;arg);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Out2</span>&nbsp;Op2(<span style="color:#2b91af;">In2</span>&nbsp;arg);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Out3</span>&nbsp;Op3(<span style="color:#2b91af;">In3</span>&nbsp;arg);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;More&nbsp;operations...</span>
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to create a Composite, we must be able to take an arbitrary number of implementations and make them look like a single object.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Composite as monoid</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		You have a set of implementations of <code>IInterface1</code>. In order to create a Composite, you loop over all of those implementations in order to produce an aggregated result:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Out1</span>&nbsp;Op1(<span style="color:#2b91af;">In1</span>&nbsp;arg)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">foreach</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;imp&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.imps)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;out1&nbsp;=&nbsp;imp.Op1(arg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Somehow&nbsp;combine&nbsp;this&nbsp;out1&nbsp;value&nbsp;with&nbsp;previous&nbsp;values</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Return&nbsp;combined&nbsp;Out1&nbsp;value</span>
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This implies that we have an ordered, finite sequence of implementations: <em>imp1, imp2, imp3, ...</em>. In C#, we could represent such a sequence with the type <code>IReadOnlyCollection&lt;IInterface1&gt;</code>. Somehow, we need to turn that collection into a single <code>IInterface1</code> value. In other words, we need a translation of the type <code>IReadOnlyCollection&lt;IInterface1&gt; -&gt; IInterface1</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we look to <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> for inspiration for a moment, let's replace <code>IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> with Haskell's built-in linked list. This means that we need a function of the type <code>[IInterface1] -&gt; IInterface1</code>, or, more generally, <code>[a] -&gt; a</code>. This function exists for all <code>a</code> as long as <code>a</code> is a monoid; it's called <code>mconcat</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>mconcat :: Monoid a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		We also know from a previous article that <a href="">a collection of monoids can be reduced to a single monoid</a>. If <code>IInterface1</code> can form a monoid, then you can make a Composite.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Objects as monoids</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		When can an object (like <code>IInterface1</code>) form a monoid?
	</p>
	<p>
		From <a href="">object isomorphisms</a> we know that we can decompose an object with <em>n</em> members to <em>n</em> objects each with one member. This means that instead of analysing all of <code>IInterface1</code>, we can consider the properties of each method in isolation. The properties of an object is the consolidation of the properties of all the methods.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall, still from <em>object isomorphisms</em>, that we can represent an object as a tuple of functions. Moreover, <a href="">if you have a tuple of monoids, then the tuple is also a monoid</a>!
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to make an object a monoid, then, you have to make each method a monoid. When is a method a monoid? <a href="">A method is a monoid when its return type is a monoid</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's it. An interface like <code>IInterface1</code> is a monoid when <code>Out1</code>, <code>Out2</code>, <code>Out3</code>, and so on, are monoids. If that's the case, you can make a Composite.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Examples</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		From <em>unit isomorphism</em>, we know that we can represent C#'s and Java's <em>void</em> keywords with methods returning <em>unit</em>, and <em>unit</em> is a monoid. All methods that return <code>void</code> can be part of a Composite, but we already knew that <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/03/22/CommandsareComposable">Commands are composable</a>. If you search for examples of the Composite design pattern, you'll find more than one variation involving drawing shapes on a digital canvas, with the central operation being a <code>Draw</code> method with a <code>void</code> return type.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another example could be calculation of the price of a shopping basket. If you have an interface method of the type <code>decimal Calculate(Basket basket)</code>, you could have several implementations:
		<ul>
			<li>Add all the item prices together</li>
			<li>Apply a discount (a negative number)</li>
			<li>Calculate sales tax</li>
		</ul>
		These could be three implementations of the same interface method, and since decimal numbers form a monoid over addition, then you can make a Composite basket calculator out of the three implementations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Boolean values also form at least two monoids (<em>any</em> and <em>all</em>), so any method you have that returns a Boolean value can be used in a Composite. You could, for example, have a list of criteria for granting a loan. Each such business rule returns <code>true</code> if it evaluates that the loan should be granted, and <code>false</code> otherwise. If you have more than one business rule, you can create a Composite that returns <code>true</code> only if all the individual rules return <code>true</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have a method that returns a string, then that is also a candidate for inclusion in a Composite, if string concatenation makes sense in the domain in question.
	</p>
	<p>
		You probably find it fairly mundane that you can create a Composite if all the methods involved return numbers, strings, Booleans, or nothing. The result generalises, however, to all monoids, including more complex types.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Granularity</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The result, then, is that you can make a Composite when <em>all</em> methods in your interface have monoid return types. If only a single method has a return type that isn't a monoid, you can't aggregate that value, and you can't make a Composite (there are some exceptions; see below).
	</p>
	<p>
		Your interface can have as many methods you like, but they must all be monoids. Even one rogue method will prevent you from being able to create a Composite. This is another argument for <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/RoleInterface.html">Role Interfaces</a>. The smaller an interface is, the more likely it is that you can make a Composite out of it. If you follow that line of reasoning to its ultimate conclusion, you'll <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/03/10/solid-the-next-step-is-functional">design your interfaces with a single member each</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Relaxation</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		There can be some exceptions to the rule that all return values must be monoids. If you have at least one implementation of your interface, then a <a href="">semigroup</a> may be enough. Recall that monoids accumulate like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Foo</span>&nbsp;Accumulate(<span style="color:#2b91af;">IReadOnlyCollection</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Foo</span>&gt;&nbsp;foos)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;acc&nbsp;=&nbsp;Identity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">foreach</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;f&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">in</span>&nbsp;foos)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acc&nbsp;=&nbsp;acc.Op(f);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;acc;
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		You only need <code>Identity</code> in order to start the accumulation, and to have something to return in case you have no implementations. If you have at least one implementation, you don't need the identity, and then a semigroup is enough. Consider the <a href="">bounding box example</a>. If you have a method that returns <code>BoundingBox</code> values, you can still make a Composite out of such an interface, as long as you have at least one implementation. There's no 'identity' bounding box, but it makes intuitive sense that you can still compose bounding boxes into bigger bounding boxes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Haskell formalises the rule for semigroups:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>sconcat :: Semigroup a =&gt; Data.List.NonEmpty.NonEmpty a -&gt; a</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>sconcat</code> function reduces any non-empty list of any semigroup <code>a</code> to a single <code>a</code> value.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have a non-empty list of implementations, then perhaps you don't even need a semigroup. Perhaps any <a href="">magma</a> will work. Be aware, however, that the lack of associativity will cause the order of implementations to matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Technically, you may be able to program a Composite from a magma, but I'd suggest caution. The monoid and semigroup laws are intuitive. A magma without those properties may not form an intuitive Composite. While it may compile, it may have surprising, or counter-intuitive, behaviour. I'd favour sticking to monoids or semigroups.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Summary</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		When is an object-oriented design composable? Composition could mean more than one thing, but this article has focused exclusively on the Composite design pattern. When can you use the Composite pattern? When all method return types are monoids.
