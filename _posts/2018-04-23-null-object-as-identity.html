		<em>When can you implement a Null Object? When the return types of your methods are monoids.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		This article is part of <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/03/05/some-design-patterns-as-universal-abstractions">a series of articles about design patterns and their category theory counterparts</a>. In a <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/03/12/composite-as-a-monoid">previous article</a> you learned how there's a strong relationship between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern">Composite</a> design pattern and <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/10/06/monoids">monoids</a>. In this article you'll see that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern">Null Object</a> pattern is essentially a special case of the Composite pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also think that there's a relationship between monoidal <em>identity</em> and the Null Object pattern similar to the relationship between Composite and monoids in general:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/null-object-identity-set-diagram.png" alt="Set diagram showing identity as a subset of Null Object.">
	</p>
	<p>
		Once more, I don't claim that an isomorphism exists. You may be able to produce Null Object examples that aren't monoidal, but on the other hand, I believe that all identities are Null Objects.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Null Object</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		While the Null Object design pattern isn't one of the patterns covered in <a href="http://amzn.to/XBYukB">Design Patterns</a>, I consider it a <em>structural pattern</em> because Composite is a structural pattern, and Null Object is a special case of Composite.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bobby Woolf's <a href="http://amzn.to/1dEKjcj">original text</a> contains an example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, and while I'm no Smalltalk expert, I think a fair translation to C# would be an interface like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">interface</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IController</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;IsControlWanted();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;IsControlActive();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;Startup();
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The idea behind the Null Object pattern is to add an implementation that 'does nothing', which in the example would be this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">class</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">NullController</span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IController</span>
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;IsControlActive()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">false</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;IsControlWanted()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">false</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;Startup()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Woolf calls his implementation <code>NoController</code>, but I find it more intent-revealing to call it <code>NullController</code>. Both of the Boolean methods return <code>false</code>, and the <code>Startup</code> method literally does nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Doing nothing</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		What exactly does it mean to 'do nothing'? In the case of the <code>Startup</code> method, it's clear, because it's a bona fide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP">no-op</a>. This is possible for all methods without return values (i.e. methods that return <code>void</code>), but for all other methods, the compiler will insist on a return value.
	</p>
	<p>
		For <code>IsControlActive</code> and <code>IsControlWanted</code>, Woolf solves this by returning <code>false</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Is <code>false</code> always the correct 'do nothing' value for Booleans? And what should you return if a method returns an integer, a string, or a custom type? The original text is vague on that question:
		<blockquote>
			"Exactly what "do nothing" means is subjective and depends on the sort of behavior the Client is expecting."
		</blockquote>
		Sometimes, you can't get any closer than that, but I think that often it's possible to be more specific.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Doing nothing as identity</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		From <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/01/15/unit-isomorphisms">unit isomorphisms</a> you know that methods without return values are isomorphic to methods that return <em>unit</em>. You also know that <em>unit</em> is a monoid. What does <em>unit</em> and <code>bool</code> have in common? They both form monoids; <code>bool</code>, in fact, forms four different monoids, of which <em>all</em> and <em>any</em> are the best-known.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my experience, you can implement the Null Object pattern by returning various 'do nothing' values, depending on their types:
		<ul>
			<li>For <code>bool</code>, return a constant value. Usually, <code>false</code> is the appropriate 'do nothing' value, but it does depend on the semantics of the operation.</li>
			<li>For <code>string</code>, return <code>""</code>.</li>
			<li>For collections, return an empty collection.</li>
			<li>For numbers, return a constant value, such as <code>0</code>.</li>
			<li>For <code>void</code>, do nothing, which is equivalent to returning <em>unit</em>.</li>
		</ul>
		What all of these have in common is that they return the <em>identity</em> of the monoid in question. Keep in mind that for some types, such as <code>bool</code> and <code>int</code>, more than one monoid exist, and the identity depends on which one you pick:
		<ul>
			<li>The identity for the <em>any</em> monoid is <code>false</code>.</li>
			<li>The <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/10/10/strings-lists-and-sequences-as-a-monoid">identity for <code>string</code> is <code>""</code></a>.</li>
			<li>The identity for collections is the empty collection.</li>
			<li>The identity for the <em>addition</em> monoid is <code>0</code>.</li>
			<li>The identity for <em>unit</em> is <em>unit</em>.</li>
		</ul>
		Recall what the <em>identity</em> of a monoid is: it's the value that, when applied to another value, doesn't change the other value:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>foo.Op(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Foo</span>.Identity)&nbsp;==&nbsp;foo</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		In other words: the <em>identity does nothing!</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		As a preliminary result, then, when all return values of your interface form monoids, you can create a Null Object.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Relationship with Composite</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the previous article, you saw how the Composite design pattern was equivalent with the <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> function <code>mconcat</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>mconcat :: Monoid a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This function, however, seems more limited than it has to be. It says that if you have a linked list of monoidal values, you can reduce them to a single monoidal value. Is this only true for linked lists?
	</p>
	<p>
		After all, in a language like C#, you'd typically express a Composite as a container of 'some collection' of objects, typically modelled by the <code>IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> interface. There are several implementations of that interface, including lists, arrays, collections, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		It seems as though we ought to be able to generalise <code>mconcat</code>, and, indeed, we can. The <code>Data.Foldable</code> module defines a function called <code>fold</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>fold :: (Monoid m, Foldable t) =&gt; t m -&gt; m</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Let me decipher that for you. It says that any monoid <code>m</code> contained in a 'foldable' container <code>t</code> can be reduced to a single value (still of the type <code>m</code>). You can read <code>t m</code> as 'a foldable container that contains monoids'. In C#, you could attempt to express it as <code>IFoldable&lt;TMonoid&gt;</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other words, the Composite design pattern is equivalent to <code>fold</code>. Here's how it relates to the Null Object pattern:
	</p>
	<p>
		As a first step, consider methods like those defined by the above <code>IController</code> interface. In order to implement <code>NullController</code>, all of those methods ignore their (non-existent) input and return an identity value. In other words, we're looking for a Haskell function of the type <code>Monoid m =&gt; a -&gt; m</code>; that is: a function that takes input of the type <code>a</code> and returns a monoidal value <code>m</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can do that using <code>fold</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#600277;">nullify</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Monoid</span>&nbsp;m&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;m
nullify&nbsp;<span style="color:#666666;">=</span>&nbsp;fold&nbsp;(<span style="color:#dd0000;">Identity</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#666666;">$</span>&nbsp;const&nbsp;mempty)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall that the input to <code>fold</code> must be a <code>Foldable</code> container. The good old <code>Identity</code> type is, among other capabilities, <code>Foldable</code>. That takes care of the container. The value that we put into the container is a single function that ignores its input (<code>const</code>) and always returns the identity value (<code>mempty</code>). The result is a function that always returns the identity value.
	</p>
	<p>
		This demonstrates that Null Object is a special case of Composite, because <code>nullify</code> is a special application of <code>fold</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's no reason to write <code>nullify</code> in such a complicated way, though. You can simplify it like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#600277;">nullify</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Monoid</span>&nbsp;m&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;m
nullify&nbsp;<span style="color:#666666;">=</span>&nbsp;const&nbsp;mempty</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you recall, however, that <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/11/06/function-monoids">functions are monoids if their return values are monoids</a>, you can simplify it even further:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#600277;">nullify</span>&nbsp;::&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">Monoid</span>&nbsp;m&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;m
nullify&nbsp;<span style="color:#666666;">=</span>&nbsp;mempty</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The identity element for monoidal functions is exactly a function that ignores its input and returns <code>mempty</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Controller identity</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider the <code>IController</code> interface. According to <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/02/12/object-isomorphisms">object isomorphisms</a>, you can represent this interface as a tuple of three functions:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">type</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#dd0000;">Controller</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#666666;">=</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span style="color:#dd0000;">ControllerState</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#666666;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#dd0000;">Any</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#dd0000;">ControllerState</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#666666;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#dd0000;">Any</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#dd0000;">ControllerState</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#666666;">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">()</span>)</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is cheating a little, because the third tuple element (the one that corresponds to <code>Startup</code>) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a>, although I strongly suspect that the intent is that it should mutate the state of the Controller. Two alternatives are to change the function to either <code>ControllerState -&gt; ControllerState</code> or <code>ControllerState -&gt; IO ()</code>, but I'm going to keep things simple. It doesn't change the conclusion.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that I've used <code>Any</code> as the return type for the two first tuples. As I've previously covered, Booleans form monoids like <em>any</em> and <em>all</em>. Here, we need to use <code>Any</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This tuple is a monoid because all three functions are monoids, and <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/10/30/tuple-monoids">a tuple of monoids is itself a monoid</a>. This means that you can easily create a Null Object using <code>mempty</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>λ&gt; nullController = mempty :: Controller</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>nullController</code> is a triad of functions. You can access them by pattern-matching them, like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>λ&gt; (isControlWanted, isControlActive, startup) = nullController</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now you can try to call e.g. <code>isControlWanted</code> with various values in order to verify that it always returns false. In this example, I cheated and simply made <code>ControllerState</code> an alias for <code>String</code>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>λ&gt; isControlWanted "foo"
Any {getAny = False}
λ&gt; isControlWanted "bar"
Any {getAny = False}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		You'll get similar behaviour from <code>isControlActive</code>, and <code>startup</code> always returns <code>()</code> (<em>unit</em>).
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Relaxation</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		As Woolf wrote in the original text, what 'do nothing' means is subjective. I think it's perfectly reasonable to say that monoidal identity fits the description of doing nothing, but you could probably encounter APIs where 'doing nothing' means something else.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an example, consider avatars for online forums, such as Twitter. If you don't supply a picture when you create your profile, you get a default picture. One way to implement such a feature could be by having a 'null' avatar, which is used in place of a proper avatar. Such a default avatar object could (perhaps) be considered a Null Object, but wouldn't necessarily be monoidal. There may not even be a binary operation for avatars.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, it's likely that you could encounter or create Null Objects that aren't monoids. That's the reason that I don't claim that a Null Object always is monoidal identity, although I do think that the reverse relationship holds: if it's <em>identity</em>, then it's a Null Object.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Summary</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Monoids are associative binary operations with identity. The identity is the value that 'does nothing' in that binary operation, like, for example, <em>0</em> doesn't 'do' anything under addition. Monoids, however, can be more complex than operations on primitive values. Functions, for example, can be monoids as well, as can tuples of functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The implication of that is that objects can be monoids as well. When you have a monoidal object, then its <em>identity</em> is the 'natural' Null Object.
	</p>
	<p>
		The question was: <em>when can you implement the Null Object pattern?</em> The answer is that you can do that when all involved methods return monoids.
	</p>
