	<p>
		This article is part of <a href="/2020/06/08/the-io-container">an article series about the IO container in C#</a>. In the previous articles, you've seen how a type like <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> can be used to distinguish between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a> and impure actions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The point of the article series is to illustrate the concept that <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> uses to impose the <a href="/2018/11/19/functional-architecture-a-definition">functional interaction law</a> at compile time. The implementation details really aren't important. Still, I believe that I know my readership well enough that a substantial fraction would be left unsatisfied if I didn't share the implementation details.
	</p>
	<p>
		I consider this an appendix to the article series. It's not really what this is all about, but here it is, nonetheless.
	</p>

		Constructor <a href="#dcf2521a1b8c40df9d45e97a43cfc546" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Based on the public API <a href="/2020/06/15/io-container-in-a-parallel-c-universe">already published</a>, the constructor implementation hardly comes as a surprise.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">readonly</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Lazy</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;item;
 
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Lazy</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&gt;&nbsp;item)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">this</span>.item&nbsp;=&nbsp;item;
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> class is little more than a wrapper around <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code>, with the restriction that while you can put a <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> object into an <code>IO</code> object, you can never get it out again. Thus, the <code>item</code> is a <code>private</code> class field instead of a public property.
	</p>
	<h3 id="50d90cc423f04f5bb4e31a0d6c9b12c8">
		SelectMany <a href="#50d90cc423f04f5bb4e31a0d6c9b12c8" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		The <code>SelectMany</code> method is a little more tricky:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&nbsp;SelectMany&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Func</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;selector)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;res&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Lazy</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;&gt;(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;selector(item.Value));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IO</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Lazy</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TResult</span>&gt;(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;res.Value.item.Value));
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		To guarantee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">referential transparency</a>, we don't want the method to trigger evaluation of the lazy value, so the <code>selector</code> has to run inside a new lazy computation. This produces a lazy <code>IO</code> value that the method then has to unwrap inside another lazy computation. Such a translation from <code>Lazy&lt;IO&lt;TResult&gt;&gt;</code> to a new <code>IO</code> object with a <code>Lazy&lt;TResult&gt;</code> inside it is reminiscent of what in Haskell is known as a <em>traversal</em>.

		UnsafePerformIO <a href="#b6c088710f6340689376b0ddf3b7df01" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Finally, the <code>UnsafePerformIO</code> method isn't part of the API, but as explained in the <a href="/2020/07/06/referential-transparency-of-io">previous article</a>, this is the special method that the hypothetical parallel-world framework calls on the <code>IO&lt;Unit&gt;</code> returned by <code>Main</code> methods.
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">T</span>&nbsp;UnsafePerformIO()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;item.Value;
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Since only the framework is supposed to call this method, it's <code>internal</code> by design. The only thing it does is to force evaluation of the lazy <code>item</code>.
	</p>

		Conclusion <a href="#38830b00fbbf4911b8a7ebd723e138ea" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Most of the implementation of <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> is straightforward, with the single exception of <code>SelectMany</code>, which has to jump through a few hoops to keep the behaviour lazy until it's activated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once more I want to point out that the purpose of this article series is to explain how a type system like Haskell's guarantees referential transparency. C# could do the same, but it'd require that all impure actions in all libraries in the entire .NET ecosystem were to return <code>IO</code> values. That's not going to happen, but something similar already has happened. Read on in the next article.

				In your <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/07/13/implementation-of-the-c-io-container/">previous post</a>, you said
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Haskell is a lazily evaluated language. That's an important piece of the puzzle, so I've modelled the <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> example so that it only wraps <code>Lazy</code> values. That emulates Haskell's behaviour in C#.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				After several days, I finally feel like I fully understand this.
			</p>
			<p>
				The concept of lazy has serveral slightly different definitions depending on the context.  Haskell is a lazily evaluated language in the sense that its evaluation strategy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_need">call by need</a>.  In C#, both <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> are lazy in the sense that neither actually contains a <code>T</code>, but both could produce a <code>T</code> if asked to do so.  The difference is the presence or absence of caching.  I remember all this by saying that <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> is lazy with caching and <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> is lazy without caching.  So <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> is to call by need as <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_name">call by name</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> is the correct choice if we want to model or emulate the evaluation strategy of Haskell in C#.  What about Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>?  Is it lazy with caching or lazy without caching?  My guess was lazy without caching, but I finally installed the ghc Haskell compiler and compiled Haskell on my machine for the first time in order to test this.  I think this example shows that Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> is lazy without caching.
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>-- output: xx
main = 
  let io = putStr "x"
  in do { io ; io }</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				I think this would be equivalent C# code in this parallel world that you have created.
			</p>
			<p>
				<pre>// output: x
static IO<Unit> MainIO(string[] args) {
  var io = Console.Write("x");
  return from _1 in io
         from _2 in io
         select Unit.Instance;
}</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				What makes me think that I fully understand this now is that I think I see where you are going.  I think you already knew all this and decided to model Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> using <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> anyway because <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> is also lazy with caching just like <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code>, and your next post will discuss using <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> as a surrogate for Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>.  I think you want your C# implementation of <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code> to be more like C#'s <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> than Haskell's <code>IO&lt;T&gt;</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for including such a gem for me to think about...and enough motivation to finally put Haskell on my machine!
