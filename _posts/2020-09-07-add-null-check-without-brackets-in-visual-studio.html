	</p>
	<p>
		The most recent versions of Visual Studio have included many new <em>Quick Actions</em>, accessible with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The overall feature has been around for some years, but the product group has been adding features at a good pace recently, it seems to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		One feature has been around for at least a year: <em>Add null check</em>. In a default installation of Visual Studio, it looks like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/add-null-check-with-brackets.png" alt="Screen shot of the 'Add null check' Quick Action. By default it'll add brackets around the throw statement.">
	</p>
	<p>
		As the screen shot shows, it'll auto-generate a Guard Clause like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;Overlaps(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Reservation</span>&nbsp;other)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">if</span>&nbsp;(other&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">null</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">throw</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">ArgumentNullException</span>(<span style="color:blue;">nameof</span>(other));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;otherSeating&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Seating</span>(SeatingDuration,&nbsp;other.Date);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;Overlaps(otherSeating);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Part of my personal coding style is that I don't use brackets for one-liners. This is partially motivated by the desire to save vertical space, since I try to <a href="/2019/11/04/the-80-24-rule">keep methods as small as possible</a>. Some people worry that not using brackets for one-liners makes the code more vulnerable to defects, but I typically have automated regressions tests to keep an eye on correctness.
	</p>
	<p>
		The above default behaviour of the <em>Add null check</em> Quick Action annoyed me because I had to manually remove the brackets. It's one of those things that annoy you a little, but not enough that you throw aside what you're doing to figure out if you can change the situation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Until it annoyed me enough to investigate whether there was something I <em>could</em> do about it. It turns out to be easy to tweak the behaviour.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Visual Studio 2019, go to <em>Tools</em>, <em>Options</em>, <em>Text Editor</em>, <em>C#</em>, <em>Code Style</em>, <em>General</em> and change the <em>Prefer braces</em> option to <em>No</em>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/visual-studio-prefer-braces-option.png" alt="Screen shot of Visual Studio Options dialog box.">
	</p>
	<p>
		This changes the behaviour of the <em>Add null check</em> Quick Action:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="/content/binary/add-null-check-without-brackets.png" alt="Screen shot of the 'Add null check' Quick Action after the behaviour change. It no longer adds brackets around the throw statement.">
	</p>
	<p>
		After applying the Quick Action, my code now looks like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;Overlaps(<span style="color:#2b91af;">Reservation</span>&nbsp;other)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">if</span>&nbsp;(other&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">is</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">null</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">throw</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">ArgumentNullException</span>(<span style="color:blue;">nameof</span>(other));
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;otherSeating&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Seating</span>(SeatingDuration,&nbsp;other.Date);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;Overlaps(otherSeating);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This better fits my preference.

				The same should go for if's, switch's, try/catch and perhaps a few other things. While we are at it, spacing is also a good source for changing layout in code, e.g: decimal.Round( amount * 1.0000m, provider.Getdecimals( currency ) ) ).
