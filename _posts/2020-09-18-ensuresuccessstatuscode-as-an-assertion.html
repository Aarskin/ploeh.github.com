		Okay, I admit that sometimes I can be too literal and rigid in my thinking. At least as far back as 2012 I've been doing <a href="/outside-in-tdd">outside-in TDD</a> against self-hosted HTTP APIs. When you do that, you'll regularly need to verify that an HTTP response is successful.
	</p>

		Assert equality <a href="#77cb250db1ab4278bad68cf7736ae62e" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		You can, of course, write an assertion like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">Assert</span>.Equal(<span style="color:#2b91af;">HttpStatusCode</span>.OK,&nbsp;response.StatusCode);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		If the assertion fails, it'll produce a comprehensible message like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Assert.Equal() Failure
Expected: OK
Actual:   BadRequest</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		What's not to like?
	</p>
	<h3 id="2ba5bb17d1f8423184a50b2fa1fcb667">
		Assert success <a href="#2ba5bb17d1f8423184a50b2fa1fcb667" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		The problem with testing strict equality in this context is that it's often too narrow a definition of success.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may start by returning <code>200 OK</code> as response to a <code>POST</code> request, but then later evolve the API to return <code>201 Created</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code>. Those status codes still indicate success, and are typically accompanied by more information (e.g. a <code>Location</code> header). Thus, evolving a REST API from returning <code>200 OK</code> to <code>201 Created</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code> isn't a breaking change.
	</p>
	<p>
		It does, however, break the above assertion, which may now fail like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Assert.Equal() Failure
Expected: OK
Actual:   Created</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		You could attempt to fix this issue by instead verifying <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpresponsemessage.issuccessstatuscode">IsSuccessStatusCode</a>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">Assert</span>.True(response.IsSuccessStatusCode);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That permits the API to evolve, but introduces another problem.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		What happens when an assertion against <code>IsSuccessStatusCode</code> fails?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Assert.True() Failure
Expected: True
Actual:   False</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That's not helpful. At least, you'd like to know which other status code was returned instead. You can address that concern by using an overload to <code>Assert.True</code> (most unit testing frameworks come with such an overload):
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:#2b91af;">Assert</span>.True(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response.IsSuccessStatusCode,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">$&quot;Actual&nbsp;status&nbsp;code:&nbsp;</span>{response.StatusCode}<span style="color:#a31515;">.&quot;</span>);</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		This produces more helpful error messages:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Actual status code: BadRequest.
Expected: True
Actual:   False</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Granted, the <em>Expected: True, Actual: False</em> lines are redundant, but at least the information you care about is there; in this example, the status code was <code>400 Bad Request</code>.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		That's not bad. You can use that <code>Assert.True</code> overload everywhere you want to assert success. You can even copy and paste the code, <a href="/2014/08/07/why-dry">because it's an idiom that doesn't change</a>. Still, since <a href="/2019/11/04/the-80-24-rule">I like to stay within 80 characters line width</a>, this little phrase takes up three lines of code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Surely, a helper method can address that problem:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">internal</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;AssertSuccess(<span style="color:blue;">this</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">HttpResponseMessage</span>&nbsp;response)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Assert</span>.True(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response.IsSuccessStatusCode,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">$&quot;Actual&nbsp;status&nbsp;code:&nbsp;</span>{response.StatusCode}<span style="color:#a31515;">.&quot;</span>);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		I can now write a one-liner as an assertion:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>response.AssertSuccess();</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		What's not to like?

		If you're already familiar with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpresponsemessage">HttpResponseMessage</a> class, you may have been reading this far with some frustration. It already comes with a method called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpresponsemessage.ensuresuccessstatuscode">EnsureSuccessStatusCode</a>. Why not just use that instead?
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		As long as the <code>response</code> status code is in the 200 range, this method call succeeds, but if not, it throws an exception:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>Response status code does not indicate success: 400 (Bad Request).</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		That's exactly the information you need.
	</p>
	<p>
		I admit that I can sometimes be too rigid in my thinking. I've known about this method for years, but I never thought of it as a <em>unit testing assertion</em>. It's as if there's a category in my programming brain that's labelled <em>unit testing assertions</em>, and it only contains methods that originate from unit testing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I even knew about <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.debug.assert">Debug.Assert</a>, so I knew that assertions also exist outside of unit testing. That assertion isn't suitable for unit testing, however, so I never included it in the category of unit testing assertions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>EnsureSuccessStatusCode</code> method doesn't have <em>assert</em> in its name, but it behaves just like a unit testing assertion: it throws an exception with a useful error message if a criterion is not fulfilled. I just never thought of it as useful for unit testing purposes because it's part of 'production code'.
	</p>

	<p>
		The built-in <code>EnsureSuccessStatusCode</code> method is fine for unit testing purposes. Who knows, perhaps other class libraries contain similar assertion methods, although they may be hiding behind names that don't include <em>assert</em>. Perhaps your own production code contains such methods. If so, they can double as unit testing assertions.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've been doing test-driven development for close to two decades now, and one of many consistent experiences is this:
		<ul>
			<li>In the beginning of a project, the unit tests I write are verbose. This is natural, because I'm still getting to know the domain.</li>
			<li>After some time, I begin to notice patterns in my tests, so I refactor them. I introduce helper APIs in the test code.</li>
			<li>Finally, I realise that some of those unit testing APIs might actually be useful in the production code too, so I move them over there.</li>
		</ul>
		Test-driven development is process that gives you feedback about your production code's APIs. Listing to your tests.
