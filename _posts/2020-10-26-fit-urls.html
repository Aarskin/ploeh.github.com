	<p>
		Publishing and maintaining a true (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">level 3</a>) RESTful API is difficult. This is the style of REST design where clients are expected to <em>follow links</em> to perform the work they want to accomplish; not assemble URLs from templates.
	</p>
	<p>
		Have you ever designed a URL scheme and published it, only to later discover that you wished you'd come up with a different structure? If you've published a set of URL templates, changing your mind constitutes a breaking change. If clients follow links, however, URLs are opaque and you can redesign the URLs without breaking existing clients.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can try to document this design principle all you want, to no avail. You can <em>tell</em> client developers that they're supposed to follow links, not try to <a href="/2013/05/01/rest-lesson-learned-avoid-hackable-urls">retro-engineer the URLs</a>, and still they'll do it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I know; I've experienced it. When we later changed the URL structure, it didn't take long for the client developers to complain that we broke their code.

	<p>
		This is an example of <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com">Hyrum's law</a> in action, albeit on the scale of web service interactions, rather than low-level APIs. The presence of a discernible system to URLs suggests an <em>implicit</em> interface.
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider this 'home' resource for an online restaurant reservation system:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>GET / HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;links&quot;</span>:&nbsp;[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;rel&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urn:reservations&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;href&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;http://localhost:53568/reservations&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;rel&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urn:year&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;href&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;http://localhost:53568/calendar/2020&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;rel&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urn:month&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;href&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;http://localhost:53568/calendar/2020/10&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;rel&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urn:day&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;href&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;http://localhost:53568/calendar/2020/10/23&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;]
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		It doesn't take much interaction with the API before you realise that there's a system to the URLs provided in the links. If you want to see the calendar for a specific date, you can easily retro-engineer the URL template <code>/calendar/{yyyy}/{MM}/{dd}</code>, and <code>/calendar/{yyyy}/{MM}</code> for a month, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		The same is likely to happen with the <em>reservations</em> link. You can <code>POST</code> to this link to make a new reservation:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>POST /reservations HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;at&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;2020-12-09 19:15&quot;</span>,

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;name&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Raine&nbsp;Burroughs&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;quantity&quot;</span>:&nbsp;5
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: http://localhost:53568/reservations/fabc5bf63a1a4db38b95deaa89c01178
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;id&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;fabc5bf63a1a4db38b95deaa89c01178&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;at&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;2020-12-09T19:15:00.0000000&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;email&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;rainboughs@example.com&quot;</span>,

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;quantity&quot;</span>:&nbsp;5
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that when the API responds, its <code>Location</code> header gives you the URL for that particular reservation. It doesn't take long to figure out that there's a template there, as well: <code>/reservations/{id}</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		So client developers may just store the ID (<code>fabc5bf63a1a4db38b95deaa89c01178</code>) and use the implied template to construct URLs on the fly. And who can blame them?
	</p>
	<p>
		That, however, misses the point of REST. The ID of that reservation isn't <code>fabc5bf63a1a4db38b95deaa89c01178</code>, but rather <code>http://localhost:53568/reservations/fabc5bf63a1a4db38b95deaa89c01178</code>. Yes, the URL, all of it, is the ID.

	</h3>
	<p>
		Why does that matter?
	</p>
	<p>
		It matters because you're human, and you make mistakes. Or, rather, it's intrinsic to software development that you learn as you work. You'll make decisions at the beginning that you'll want to change as you gain more insight.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, requirements change. Consider the URL template scheme implied by the above examples. Can you spot any problems? Would you want to change anything?
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine, for example, that you've already deployed the first version of the API. It's a big success. Now the product owner wants to expand the market to more restaurants. She wants to make the service a multi-tenant API. How does that affect URLs?
	</p>
	<p>
		In that new context, perhaps URLs like <code>/restaurants/1/reservations</code> or <code>/restaurants/90125/calendar/2020/10</code> would be better.
	</p>
	<p>
		That, however, would be a breaking change if clients construct URLs based on implied templates.
	</p>
	<p>
		Couldn't you just pass the restaurant ID as an HTTP header instead of in the URL? Yes, technically you could do that, but that doesn't work well with HTTP caching. It's not a RESTful thing to do, for that, and other, reasons.
	</p>

	</h3>
	<p>
		Do we just give up in the face of Hyrum's law? Or can we keep URLs evolvable? In evolution, organisms evolve according to a 'fitness function', so to name such URLs, we could call them <em>fit URL</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To keep URLs fit, we must prevent client developers from retro-engineering the implied interface. My original thought was to give each URL an opaque ID, such as a GUID, but <a href="/2013/05/01/rest-lesson-learned-avoid-hackable-urls#424bd3f6199e422c8294e300d312ffb4">in 2015 Dan Kubb instead suggested to sign the URLs</a>. What a great idea!
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do that, then the above home resource might look like this:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;links&quot;</span>:&nbsp;[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;rel&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urn:reservations&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;href&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;http://localhost:53568/restaurants/1/reservations?sig=1WiLlS5705bfsffPzaFYLwntrS4FCjE5CLdaeYTHxxg%3D&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;rel&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urn:year&quot;</span>,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;rel&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urn:month&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;href&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;http://localhost:53568/restaurants/1/calendar/2020/10?sig=mGqkAjY7vMbC5Fr7UiRXWWnjn3pFn21MYrMagpdWaU0%3D&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2e75b6;">&quot;rel&quot;</span>:&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;urn:day&quot;</span>,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;]
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Even if you can still figure out what the URL templates are, it doesn't avail you. Creating a new reservation may return a URL like <code>https://localhost:53568/restaurants/1/reservations/fabc5bf63a1a4db38b95deaa89c01178?sig=8e80PmVi8aSS1UH6iSJ73nHmOsCLrUMs7yggEOkvEqo%3D</code>, but you can't just replace the ID with another ID and expect it to work:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>GET /restaurants/1/reservations/79520877ef4f4acdb69838e22ad04510sig=8e80PmVi8aSS1UH6iSJ73nHmOsCLrUMs7yggEOkvEqo%3D HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		You're requesting a URL that doesn't exist, so the result is <code>404 Not Found</code>. To be clear: yes, there <em>is</em> a reservation with the ID <code>79520877ef4f4acdb69838e22ad04510sig</code>, but its URL isn't the above URL.

		In two articles, I'll show you how to implement <em>fit URLs</em> in ASP.NET Core.
		<ul>
			<li>Signing URLs with ASP.NET</li>
			<li>Checking signed URLs with ASP.NET</li>
		</ul>
		The ASP.NET framework comes with enough extensibility points to make this a non-intrusive operation. I implemented this using a filter and a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">Decorators</a> in a way so that you can easily turn the feature on or off.

	</h3>
	<p>
		One of the major benefits of true RESTful API design is that it's evolvable. It enables you to learn and improve as you go, without breaking existing clients.
	</p>
	<p>
		You have to take care, however, that clients don't retro-engineer the URL templates that you may be using for implementation purposes. You want to be able to change URLs in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hyrum's law suggests that clients will rely on undocumented features if they can. By signing the URLs you keep them fit to evolve.
