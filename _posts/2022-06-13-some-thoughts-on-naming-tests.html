	</p>
	<p>
		Years ago I was participating in a coding event where we <a href="/2020/01/13/on-doing-katas">did katas</a>. My pairing partner and I was doing <em>silent ping pong</em>. Ping-pong style pair programming is when one programmer writes a test and passes the keyboard to the partner, who writes enough code to pass the test. He or she then writes a new test and passes control back to the first person. In the <em>silent</em> variety, you're not allowed to talk. This is an exercise in communicating via code.
	</p>
	<p>
		My partner wrote a test and I made it pass. After the exercise was over, we were allowed to talk to evaluate how it went, and my partner remarked that he'd been surprised that I'd implemented the opposite behaviour of what he'd intended. (It was something where there was a fork in the logic depending on a number being less than or greater to zero; I don't recall the exact details.)
	</p>
	<p>
		We looked at the test that he had written, and sure enough: He'd named the test by clearly indicating one behaviour, but then he'd written an assertion that looked for the opposite behaviour.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hadn't even noticed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I didn't read the test name. I only considered the test body, because that's the executable specification.

	<p>
		I've been thinking about test names ever since. What is the role of a test name?
	</p>
	<p>
		In some languages, you write unit tests as methods or functions. That's how you do it in C#, Java, and many other languages:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[Theory]
[InlineData(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Home&quot;</span>)]
[InlineData(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Calendar&quot;</span>)]
[InlineData(<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Reservations&quot;</span>)]
<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">void</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#74531f;">WithControllerHandlesSuffix</span>(<span style="color:blue;">string</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">name</span>)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">sut</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;UrlBuilder();
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">actual</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;sut.WithController(name&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Controller&quot;</span>);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">expected</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;sut.WithController(name);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.Equal(expected,&nbsp;actual);
}</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Usually, when we define new class methods, we've learned that naming is important. Truly, this applies to test methods, too?
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet, other languages don't use class methods to define tests. The most common JavaScript frameworks don't, and <a href="/2018/05/07/inlined-hunit-test-lists">neither does Haskell HUnit</a>. Instead, tests are simply values with labels.
	</p>
	<p>
		This hints at something that may be important.
	</p>

		The role of test names <a href="#03845212a1284263a6cdf452e7fd0bea" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		If tests aren't necessarily class methods, then what role do names play?
	</p>
	<p>
		Usually, when considering method names, it's important to provide a descriptive name in order to help client developers. A client developer writing calling code must figure out which methods to call on an object. Good names help with that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Automated tests, on the other hand, have no explicit callers. There's no client developer to communicate with. Instead, a test framework such as <a href="https://xunit.net">xUnit.net</a> scans the public API of a test suite and automatically finds the test methods to execute.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most prominent motivation for writing good method names doesn't apply here. We must reevaluate the role of test names, also keeping in mind that with some frameworks, in some languages, tests aren't even methods.

	<p>
		The story that introduces this article has a point. When considering a test, I tend to go straight to the test body. I only read the test name if I find the test body unclear.
	</p>
	<p>
		Does this mean that the test name is irrelevant? Should we simply number the tests: <code>Test1</code>, <code>Test212</code>, and so on?
	</p>
	<p>
		That hardly seems like a good idea - not even to a person like me who considers the test name secondary to the test definition.
	</p>
	<p>
		This begs the question, though: If <code>Test42</code> isn't a good name, then what does a good test name look like?

		Naming schemes <a href="#bf895999bc034985ab10e839a69be5d4" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Various people suggest naming schemes. In the .NET world many people like <a href="https://osherove.com/blog/2005/4/3/naming-standards-for-unit-tests.html">Roy Osherove's naming standard for unit tests</a>: <code>[UnitOfWork_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior]</code>. I find it too verbose to my tastes, but my point isn't to attack this particular naming scheme. In my <a href="/2016/02/10/types-properties-software">Types + Properties = Software</a> article series, I experimented with using a poor man's version of <em>Given When Then:</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre>[&lt;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Property</span>&gt;]
<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">``Given&nbsp;deuce&nbsp;when&nbsp;player&nbsp;wins&nbsp;then&nbsp;score&nbsp;is&nbsp;correct``</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(winner&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Player</span>)&nbsp;=
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;actual&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="color:#4ec9b0;">Score</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">scoreWhenDeuce</span>&nbsp;winner
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">let</span>&nbsp;expected&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:navy;">Advantage</span>&nbsp;winner
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected&nbsp;=!&nbsp;actual</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		It was a worthwhile experiment, but I don't think I ever used that style again. After all, <em>Given When Then</em> is just another way of saying <em>Arrange Act Assert</em>, and I already <a href="/2013/06/24/a-heuristic-for-formatting-code-according-to-the-aaa-pattern">organise my test code according to the AAA pattern</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		These days, I don't follow any particular naming scheme, but I do keep a guiding principle in mind.
	</p>

	<p>
		A test name, whether it's a method name or a label, is an opportunity to communicate with the reader of the code. You can communicate via code, via names, via comments, and so on. A test name is more like a mandatory comment than a normal method name.
	</p>
	<p>
		Books like <a href="/ref/clean-code">Clean Code</a> make a compelling case that comments should be secondary to good names. The point isn't that all comments are bad, but that some are:
	</p>
	<p>
		<pre><span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#1f377f;">z</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Add&nbsp;x&nbsp;and&nbsp;y</span></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		It's rarely a good idea to add a comment that describes what the code <em>does</em>. This should already be clear from the code itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		A comment can still provide important information that code can't easily do. It may explain the <em>purpose</em> of the code. I try to take this into account when naming tests: Not repeat what the code does, but suggest a hint about its raison d'Ãªtre.
	</p>
	<p>
		I try to strike a balance between <code>Test2112</code> and <code>Given&nbsp;deuce&nbsp;when&nbsp;player&nbsp;wins&nbsp;then&nbsp;score&nbsp;is&nbsp;correct</code>. I view the task of naming tests as equivalent to producing section headings in an article like this one. They offer a hint at the kind of information that might be available in the section (<em>The role of test names</em>, <em>How tests are named</em>, or <em>Information channel</em>), but sometimes they're more tongue-in-cheek than helpful (<em>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world</em>). I tend to name tests with a similar degree of precision (or lack thereof): <code>HomeReturnsJson</code>, <code>NoHackingOfUrlsAllowed</code>, <code>GetPreviousYear</code>, etcetera.
	</p>
	<p>
		These names, in isolation, hardly tell you what the tests are about. I'm okay with that, because I don't think that they have to.

	</h3>
	<p>
		I occasionally discuss this question with other people. It seems to me that it's one of the topics where Socratic questioning breaks down:
	</p>
	<p>
		Them: <em>How do you name tests?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Me: <em>I try to strike a balance between information and not repeating myself.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Them: <em>How do you like this particular naming scheme?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Me: <em>It looks verbose to me. It seems to be repeating what's already in the test code.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Them: <em>I like to read the test name to see what the test does.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Me: <em>If the name and test code disagree, which one is right?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Them: <em>The test name should follow the naming scheme.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Me: <em>Why do you find that important?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Them: <em>It's got... electrolytes.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		Okay, I admit that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire">I'm a being uncharitable</a>, but the point that I'm after is that test names are <em>different</em>, yet most people seem to reflect little on this.
	</p>
	<p>
		When do you read test names?
	</p>
	<p>
		Personally, I rarely read or otherwise <em>use</em> test names. When I'm writing a test, I also write the name, but at that point I don't really <em>need</em> the name. Sometimes I start with a placeholder name (<code>Foo</code>), write the test, and change the name once I understand what the test does.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once a test is written, ideally it should just be sitting there as a regression test. <a href="/2013/04/02/why-trust-tests">The less you touch it, the better you can trust it</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may have hundreds or thousands of tests. When you run your test suite, you care about the outcome. Did it pass or fail? The outcome is the result of a Boolean <em>and</em> operation. The test suite only passes when all tests pass, but you don't have to look at each test result. The aggregate result is enough as long as the test suite passes.
	</p>
	<p>
		You only need to look at a test when it fails. When this happens, most tools enable you to go straight to the failing test by clicking on it. (And if this isn't possible, I usually find it easier to navigate to the failing test either by line number or by copying the test name and navigating to it by pasting the name into my editor's navigation UI.) You don't really need the name to find a failing test. If the test was named <code>Test1337</code> it would be as easy to find as if it was named <code>Given&nbsp;deuce&nbsp;when&nbsp;player&nbsp;wins&nbsp;then&nbsp;score&nbsp;is&nbsp;correct</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I look at a failing test, I start by looking at the test code and comparing that to the assertion message.
	</p>
	<p>
		Usually, when a test fails, it breaks for a reason. A code change caused the test to fail. Often, the offending change was one you did ten seconds earlier. Armed with an assertion message and the test code, I usually understand the problem right away.
	</p>
	<p>
		In rare cases the test is one that I've never seen before, and I'm confused about its purpose. This is when I read the test name. At that point, I appreciate if the name is helpful.
	</p>

		Conclusion <a href="#62f1324f399243c393c77a3cbb46f173" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I'm puzzled that people are so <a href="/2021/03/22/the-dispassionate-developer">passionate</a> about test names. I consider them the least important part of a test. A name isn't irrelevant, but I find the test code more important. The code is an executable specification. It expresses the desired truth about a system.
	</p>
	<p>
		Test code is code that has the same lifetime as the production code. It pays to structure it as well as the production code. If a test is well-written, you should be able to understand it without reading its name.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's an ideal, and in reality we are fallible. Thus, providing a helpful name gives the reader a second chance to understand a test. The name shouldn't, however, be your first priority.
