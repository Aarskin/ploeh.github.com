<p>
  This blog is mostly a work of passion; it doesn't pay my bills. Since late 2011 I've been self-employed, so I'm available for hire. Here's what I can do for you:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Custom software development.</strong> I love writing code, so obviously, I'd also like writing code for you; small or big tasks - it doesn't really matter. I can work in a team, or by myself, as necessary; remote or on-site. These days, I prefer Haskell and F#, but I have more than a decade of experience with C#, so that's also possible. I'd also be interested in working with other platforms or languages (particularly PureScript or Idris), but I'd first need to ramp up on those.</li>
    <li><strong>Software architecture.</strong> Apart from experience with nitty-gritty coding details, I also have years of experience with system architecture, including REST, SOA, batch systems, etc. If you need help with the big picture, I may be able to help as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Sparring.</strong> If you need to improve your skills in e.g. Test-Driven Development, API design, refactoring, Unit Testing, Functional Programming, Object-Oriented Design, etc. I can pair with you, or otherwise join you with the purpose of transferring knowledge and experience while solving real problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Development process.</strong> During my career, I've experienced a wide range of development processes, including LEAN Software Development, SCRUM, Open Source development, MSF, and even RUP. I've been doing Test-Driven Development since 2003, and also have experience with Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Git, and GitHub workflows. If you need help with your development process, I may be able to coach you.</li>
    <li><strong>Code reviews.</strong> If you want me to review your code, I'll be happy to do so. Usually, I tell my customers that they should start by running a code analysis tool (like the built-in Code Analysis feature in Visual Studio), because it's free, and you get more value out of my code reviews if you already get the obvious issues out of the way before I start looking at the code. I particularly look for issues relating to readability, encapsulation, coupling, maintainability, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Training.</strong> I regularly talk at conferences, but I can also visit your company to deliver lectures and workshops. You are welcome to take a look at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/ploeh">my Lanyrd profile</a> to get an idea about current and past topics, but feel free to <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/about">contact me</a> to discuss topics; I can most likely tailor something that fits your requirements. Apart from tailored training, I also have a small catalogue of off-the-shelf workshops:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Craftsmanship.</strong> A full day of inspiration, controversial views on software development, and lots of hands-on exercises.</li>
        <li><strong>Property Based Testing.</strong> Learn a new way to test your software. A day with F#, FsCheck, and lots of hands-on exercises.</li>
        <li><strong>Unit testing and TDD.</strong> Over the years, I've hosted several half-day and full-day workshops on unit testing and Test Driven Development. I have so much material on this subject in C# or F# that I can probably put something together to your liking.</li>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation and SOLID.</strong> <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1017843&b=611266&m=53701&afftrack=&urllink=www%2Epluralsight%2Ecom%2Fcourses%2Fencapsulation%2Dsolid">My hit Pluralsight course</a> originally started out as a one-day workshop, complete with exercises, Q&amp;A, etc. You can still experience this material on-site, in-person!</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Round table.</strong> Sometimes people simply want to have a meeting with me to discuss various topics - typically Test-Driven Development, software design, architecture, and the like. I'm happy to visit you for a meeting with you and your team, where we can discuss your questions, sketch together on a whiteboard, look at code examples, etc., in an ad hoc fashion.</li>
  </ul>
  This list isn't exhaustive, so if you have other ideas for how you think I may be able to help you, please <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/about">contact me</a>.

<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>
  During my time as an independent advisor, I've worked for a variety of customers, some of whom have been kind enough to share their experiences with the world:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "Mark inspired all our developers with a solid and fun introduction to Software Craftsmanship. He has a special gift for addressing developers - I think it's because he really knows his stuff deep down in the code, but still manages to make high level concepts understandable.
  </p>
  <p>
    "He is passionate about what really matters, and therefore presents clearly and interestingly - sometimes even with surprising viewpoints that push you in a new and better direction."

  <p>
    "We invited Mark to a presentation of F# and how its type system can concisely model a problem domain, as part of Schantz' ongoing developer training. Mark is a terrific speaker who is able to convey highly technical subject matter in an understandable and entertaining manner, and his presentation inspired us to further explore how we can best express the domain models in our applications."

    "In March 2013, we asked Mark to help us out with several TDD related issues we were having. We were pleasantly surprised by Mark's ability to provide us <em>bespoke</em> answers and bring a <em>seasoned</em> perspective. To any team, either struggling or wishing to hone their skills, I can highly recommend Mark's services. If you ever read a post on his blog or worked with one of his open source projects, <em>this</em> is the quality you're getting in-person."

    "While rewriting a major internal application, we approached Mark to conduct a few code reviews for us. We were new to DI and our development team had recently finished his book. The team agreed some extra assistance was needed. Mark's approach to code reviews was completely different than anything we had experienced in the past. We were expecting a fact checker along with a few suggestions, but were delighted to receive a computer science professor, as well as a depth of knowledge and experience unrivaled by previous reviewers. Our time with Mark was an exceptional educational experience for the entire team. Mark gave us feedback throughout the day. The reviews were so insightful that we had developers voluntarily arriving at 6 A.M. to listen and interact with Mark. Our team wholeheartedly endorses Mark. His expert service provides tremendous value."

    "Mark created a software craftsmanship education plan for our more than 60 developers and produced the content for the first education module, which he also taught. The entire plan has been very well received by our developers, with feedback such as:
    <ul>
      <li>'Mark is an excellent presenter. Good examples and theory was well explained.'</li>
      <li>'Mark is very inspiring.'"</li>

<h2>Practical issues</h2>
<p>
  If you are interested in hiring me, then please <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/about">contact me</a>. While I'm based in Copenhagen, Denmark, I can travel to you if necessary, as long as I don't have to stay away from my family for too long; in this case, you'll need to cover my travel expenses as well, although I sometimes include that in a fixed price offer. Collaboration over the internet is obviously a less expensive alternative.
</p>
<p>
  Usually I charge by the hour, but sometimes (e.g. for training) I can also give you a fixed price offer. My prices are high - expect to pay more than you would normally pay for a development consultant, but slightly less than a licensed lawyer, accountant, management consultant, or similar. My price may vary with the nature and length of the assignment. Also depending on the nature of the task, I may ask for a retainer fee. Please <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/about">contact me</a> for details.
